% Function to go from vectorised MUAPs to a grid based on the electrode
% coordinates. This is for a 5x13 grid from OTB
%
% Input:    muap = a matrix of muaps with channels along rows and time
%               along columns (2D)
%
% Output:   muap_grid = rearranging the muap to 3D
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Define coordinates for 5x13 grid

coordinates=[coordinates_1 coordinates_2];

% Pre-define spatio-temporal MUAP matrix

% Loop through each channel
for chs=1:size(muap,1)
